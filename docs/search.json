    "text": "2.1 Technical Description\nFor the proposed project, we will be utilizing data from data.ny.gov, focusing on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) NYC Transport’s historical express bus service data. This data offers insights into the load percentages of bus routes across different directions, boroughs, and times within New York state.\nThe data for our research is primarily collected by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). It is gathered systematically from the operational systems of the MTA, providing a comprehensive overview of express bus load dynamics. The data set spans from January 2023 to the latest update on October 16, 2023. It is updated monthly and encompasses various dimensions, including load percentages, bus routes, boroughs, and time of the day.\nThe data set is reliable due to its comprehensive nature (eight columns) and a large sample size (49,300 data points), which facilitates robust inferences on load trends. We have imported the data as a CSV file, given the compatibility and ease of use of CSV datasets in the R programming environment.\nAs of now, no significant issues have been identified with the data set. The primary data source can be accessed at MTA NYC Transport’s Historical Express Bus Service Data on data.ny.gov. In case of any updates or revisions, we will refer to this specific data set page on the website for the most current information."

Each column is represented on the x-axis, and the uniform color suggests that for every column in the data set, there are no missing (NA) values.\nThe 2nd figure, titled “Missing value analysis figure 2”, displays a stacked bar chart with each bar representing a column from the data set. The bars are filled with a single color, indicating non-missing values. The absence of a second color in each bar which would have represented missing values implies that there are no missing values in any of the columns of the data set. The count on the y-axis likely represents the total number of non-missing observations for each column.\nBoth figures effectively communicate that the data set is complete with no missing observations for any of the variables presented. This is beneficial for data analysis as it suggests that there may not be a need for imputation strategies, and statistical analyses can proceed without the complication of handling missing data."

    "text": "3.2 Time-based Trends\n\n3.2.1 Line plot: Avg. Load Percentage of NYC Bus by Hour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.1.1 Comment:\nPeak Times: There is a clear peak in average load percentage around the 8th hour marked as the highest load at 48%, and another small peak around 16-17th hour. This likely corresponds to morning rush hour, a common time for people to commute to work or school, and the night rush hour, a common time for going home after work.\nLowest Load: The graph points out the lowest load percentage at 18%, which occurs around the 4th hour, likely in the very early morning when the least number of people are traveling.\nNighttime Load: There is an uptick in load percentage later in the evening, after the 20th hour, which could correspond to people returning home from late shifts or social activities.\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Barchart: Avg. Trips with APC of NYC Bus by Hour\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2.1 Comment:\nPeak Hours: The chart shows distinct peaks in the number of trips during certain hours of the day. The most prominent peak appears to be in the morning hours, around 8 AM, suggesting a morning rush hour with the highest average number of trips. There’s another less pronounced peak in the late afternoon or early evening, possibly indicating an evening rush hour.\nOff-Peak Variation: Outside of the peak hours, the number of trips decreases but fluctuates throughout the day. Midday hours show a moderate level of trips, which could be due to people traveling for non-work related reasons or staggered work schedules.\nNighttime Service: There’s a noticeable drop in the average number of trips late at night, reaching the lowest point in the early morning hours around 4 AM to 5 AM, which is expected as this is typically outside of standard commuting times.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Ridgeline plot: Load Percentage Distribution by Day Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3.1 Comment:\nDistribution Shape: The distribution of load percentages on weekdays has a wider spread than on weekends, suggesting there is more variation in bus load percentages during weekdays.\nPeaks and Load: There appear to be multiple peaks for both weekdays and weekends. This could indicate that there are specific times during the day when buses are consistently more or less loaded. The highest peak on weekdays suggests a time when buses are most consistently at a similar load percentage, possibly during rush hours.\nWeekday vs. Weekend Trends: The weekday distribution has a higher peak, which might indicate a more consistent pattern of high load percentages, likely associated with commuter traffic. The weekend distribution is broader with a less pronounced peak, suggesting a more varied load percentage, which could be due to a more irregular or leisure-based travel pattern.\nBus Utilization: The graph could suggest that buses are more heavily utilized during weekdays as compared to weekends, which would align with typical workweek patterns.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Ridgeline plot: Trip with APC Distribution by Day Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4.1 Comment:\nWeekend Peaks: The distribution for weekends has pronounced peaks, especially the very sharp peak at the lower end of the x-axis, indicating that there are many instances of a specific, lower number of trips (possibly single or very few trips on certain routes). This suggests that there’s less variability in the number of trips on weekends, with certain trip counts being far more common than others.\nWeekday Distribution: The weekday distribution is smoother and more spread out, which indicates a greater variability in trip counts. This could be due to a more uniform distribution of commuter travel spread throughout the workday.\nUse of Logarithmic Scale: By using a logarithmic scale (log2), the graph allows for easier visualization and comparison of data across a wide range of values. It’s especially useful when dealing with exponential growth or large disparities in data.\nLow Trip Counts: The first peak in the weekend distribution suggests that the lowest trip counts are more common on weekends than on weekdays. This could be due to reduced service schedules or lower demand."

NB and SB are the first 2 largest Load Percentage while WB and EB are 2 smalless, Which indicates North and South may stand more passengers while the other 2 direction have lower utilization.\nOutliers: All directions seems a lot of outliers, which are not taken into calculation consideration, I think we could further explore those and remove potential outliers which may influence our results.\nVariation: By seeing the interquantile of those directions, we can see that SB direction have more variation with respect to the load percentage, which indicates south direction should be explored further.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Horizontal barchart: Avg. Load Percentage per Borough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2.1 Comment:\nAverage Load: Staten Island shows the highest average load percentage. This could indicate a higher utilization of the transportation system, or possibly fewer transportation options leading to more crowded buses or trains.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Horizontal barchart: Avg. Trips with APC per Borough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3.1 Comment:\nAverage Trip: Staten Island stands out with a significantly higher average number of trips. This could indicate a higher frequency of trips or that fewer routes are being used more frequently. Therefore, we should combine with Average load to see it’s the bad utilization or we should actually increase more routes.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Cleveland plot: Avg. Load Percentage per Route\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.4.1 Comment:\nRoute Load Variation: There is a wide variation in the average load percentages across different routes. Some routes have a low average load, while others are approaching 50%, which indicates differences in route popularity, capacity, or possibly the time of day the data was collected.\nComparison Across Boroughs: It appears that Staten Island has several routes with higher load percentages, while routes in Queens have a lower average load.

This is fit for that Bronx and Staten Island have higher load percentage while Queens has lower percentage.\nNon-technical summary: Busyness by Time and Place: Some graphs showed how busy the buses are at different times of the day in various boroughs. For example, there are times in the morning and evening when the buses are particularly full, likely when people are going to or from work.\nDirection Matters: Other charts indicated that in some boroughs, buses going in certain directions are busier than others. This might tell us where more people work or live, or maybe where popular destinations are.\nWeekdays vs. Weekends: There’s also a difference between weekdays and weekends. Buses are consistently busier on weekdays, probably due to people’s work schedules, while weekends show more varied bus usage, reflecting more leisure or irregular travel.\nDifferent Boroughs, Different Patterns: We know that Staten Island is the Borough with highest load percentage and Trips with APC. While Bronx also have higher Load percentage, it have fewer Trips with APC, which indicates it may not utilize the transportation fully. Queens have the least load percentage, which means we may need to give less resources to Queens, and add resources to Staten Island.\nRelationship: Because there’s not clear relationship between Load percentage and Trips with APC. Therefore, we should combine both to answer the question of Route optimization and further policy and planning."

Queens have the least load percentage, which means we may need to give less resources to Queens, and add resources to Staten Island.\nRelationship: Because there’s not clear relationship between Load percentage and Trips with APC. Therefore, we should combine both to answer the question of Route optimization and further policy and planning."
